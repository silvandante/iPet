## 🔄 Daily Alarm Behavior

Each alarm (e.g. "Deworming") reschedules itself for the next day when triggered.
You can set alarms independently per pet, and they will notify you via the system notification system and reschedule automatically.

## Roadmap

- [x] Per-pet symptom tracking
- [x] Alarm + notification system
- [x] Firebase Auth and Firestore
- [x] PDF report export
- [ ] iOS version via Kotlin Multiplatform
- [ ] In-app calendar view
- [ ] Offline-first Room fallback
